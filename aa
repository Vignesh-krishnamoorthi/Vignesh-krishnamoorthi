Our Journey with Database Replay to Keep Things Running Smoothly in the Cloud Era (and with 23ai)"


In today's dynamic enterprise IT landscape, the continuous evolution of database technologies, alongside the increasing adoption of cloud environments and agile methodologies, necessitates robust and reliable performance validation strategies. Significant database changes, such as major Oracle version upgrades (e.g., to 23ai) or cloud migrations, often introduce considerable apprehension regarding potential performance regressions or unforeseen operational issues in production. Traditional testing methods frequently prove inadequate in accurately replicating the complex, dynamic characteristics of real-world production workloads.

This paper presents our experience and practical insights into the advanced application of Oracle's Database Replay, a core component of the Real Application Testing (RAT) suite. While an established tool, its strategic importance has intensified, proving to be an invaluable asset for validating critical database transformations. Database Replay uniquely captures the entirety of a live production workload—including all queries, transactions, and precise timing—and then faithfully replays this exact scenario on a test environment, offering an unparalleled capability for simulating real-world performance.

Our work details refined methodologies for maximizing the effectiveness of Database Replay. We outline approaches for ensuring high-fidelity workload capture, executing replay processes to yield truly representative performance metrics, and conducting in-depth analysis of divergence reports to identify subtle performance anomalies. Furthermore, we explore strategies for seamlessly integrating Database Replay into automated CI/CD pipelines, significantly enhancing the speed and reliability of database deployment cycles. Through illustrative case studies, we discuss common challenges encountered and the practical solutions implemented, aiming to provide actionable knowledge for fellow practitioners. Ultimately, this paper demonstrates how a disciplined approach to leveraging Oracle Database Replay empowers organizations to achieve predictable performance and mitigate operational risks for their Oracle databases amidst the complexities of 2025 and beyond.
