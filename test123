1) Identify upstream and downstream
2) Data collection:
metrics on service interactions, such as request counts and response times.
Use logging and monitoring tools to track how often each service is called.
3) Dependency Metrics:
Define what constitutes a dependency (e.g., API calls, shared databases).
Determine the weight of each dependency based on its importance or frequency of use.
4) 

Assume the following weighted scores for an upstream service:

Weights and Normalized Scores:
Call frqncy: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32
data vol: 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18
resp time: 0.2 * 0.9 = 0.18
err rate: 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02
sum: 0.32 + 0.18 + 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.67


Dependency Percentage=(Total Functionality Calls/Number of Upstream Calls )×100


Risk Description	Likelihood (1-5)	Impact (1-5)	Risk Score (L × I)	Mitigation Strategies
Data Breach	4	5	20	Implement strong encryption
Service Downtime	3	4	12	Redundant systems
Performance Degradation	2	3	6	Optimize network configuration

Risk Score=Likelihood×Impact

Likelihood Assessment: Estimate the probability of each risk occurring using historical data or expert judgment. This can be rated on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5).
Impact Analysis: Evaluate the potential impact of each risk on the organization if it were to occur. This should also be rated on a similar scale.

Identify Risks: List potential risks associated with both applications, such as data breaches, service downtime, or performance degradation due to heavy traffic.
Categorize Risks: Classify these risks into relevant categories (e.g., cybersecurity, operational, compliance).


-----------

Consider employing more sophisticated methods for risk calculation:
FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk): This method breaks down risks into components such as threat event frequency, vulnerability, and loss magnitude:
Risk=Probability of Threat Event×
Vulnerability
×
Impact
Risk=Probability of Threat Event×Vulnerability×Impact
Weighted Average Method: This involves calculating a mean of risk scores while applying weights to reflect the relative importance of different risks.
High Water Mark Method: Use this method to identify the highest risk score among all identified risks, focusing on the most critical threats.

Assuming you have calculated the following scores:
Total Risk Score = 100
Upstream Risk Score = 30
Upstream of Upstream Risk Score = 20
You would calculate:
Percentage of Upstream Risk:
