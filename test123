1) Identify upstream and downstream
2) Data collection:
metrics on service interactions, such as request counts and response times.
Use logging and monitoring tools to track how often each service is called.
3) Dependency Metrics:
Define what constitutes a dependency (e.g., API calls, shared databases).
Determine the weight of each dependency based on its importance or frequency of use.
4) 

Assume the following weighted scores for an upstream service:

Weights and Normalized Scores:
Call frqncy: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32
data vol: 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18
resp time: 0.2 * 0.9 = 0.18
err rate: 0.1 * 0.2 = 0.02
sum: 0.32 + 0.18 + 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.67


Dependency Percentage=(Total Functionality Calls/Number of Upstream Calls )Ã—100
